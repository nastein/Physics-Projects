This limit cannot be used for recasting, but is provided for
reference. Note that this limit does not use the minimal dark photon
model and makes strong assumptions about the decay of the Higgs. One
prompt bound is associated with this limit, 'CMS_CMS2018rdr_br10.lmt',
where the branching of the Higgs into two dark photons is assumed to
be 1%. These were extracted from figure 3 (shaded orange fill labeled
CMS 1%) of CMS:2018rdr.  """
