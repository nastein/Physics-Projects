This limit cannot be used for recasting, but is provided for
reference. Note that this limit does not use the minimal dark photon
model and makes strong assumptions about the decay of the Higgs. Nine
displaced bounds are associated with this limit:
'ATLAS_Aad2019tua_br1[abc].lmt', 'ATLAS_Aad2019tua_br5[ab].lmt',
'ATLAS_Aad2019tua_br10[ab].lmt', 'ATLAS_Aad2019tua_br20[ab].lmt'. Each
corresponds to an assumed branching of the Higgs into two dark
photons: 1%, 5%, 20%, and 20% respectively. These were extracted from
figure 7 (red, orange, yellow, and green fills) of Aad:2019tua.
