This reach cannot be used for recasting, but is provided for
reference. Note that this reach does not use the minimal dark photon
model and makes strong assumptions about the decay of the Higgs. One
displaced bound is associated with this limit,
'CMS_CMS2018lqz_br10.lmt', which corresponds to an assumed branching
of the Higgs into two dark photons of 10% and a 3000 ifb HL-LHC
dataset. These were extracted from figure 8b (light red fill labeled
exclusion) of CMS:2018lqx and scaled to 10%.
