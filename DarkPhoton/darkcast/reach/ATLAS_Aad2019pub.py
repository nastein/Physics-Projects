This reach cannot be used for recasting, but is provided for
reference. Note that this reach does not use the minimal dark photon
model and makes strong assumptions about the decay of the Higgs. Two
displaced bounds are associated with this limit:
'ATLAS_Aad2019pub_br1[ab].lmt' and
'ATLAS_Aad2019pub_br10[abc].lmt'. The additional letter suffix
indicates discrete regions of the bound. Each reach, given the Run 3
dataset of 300 ifb, corresponds to an assumed branching of the Higgs
into two dark photons: 1% and 10%. These were extracted from figure 14
(shaded red and orange fills labeled Run 3 and HL-LHC) of Aad:2019pub.
