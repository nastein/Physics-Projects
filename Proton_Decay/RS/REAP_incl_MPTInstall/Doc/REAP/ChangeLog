	- Error in SU(2) gauge couplings in the Models RGEMSSMTriplet and RGEMSSMTriplet0N has been corrected.

* Version 1.7 2007-03-07:
	- New Models added: RGESMTriplet and RGESMTriplet0N, which add a Higgs triplet to the SM. Also RGEMSSMTriplet and RGEMSSMTriplet0N, which add 2 Higgs triplets to the MSSM.

* Version 1.6 2006-06-30:
	- New Options can be added to all existing models, not only to 2HDM*
	
* Version 1.5.2 2006-03-27:
	- Bug removed which was introduced in Version 1.5.1: Some functions have been inserted in the model files twice leading
	to errors. Thanks to Thomas Dent who discovered the bug.
	
* Version 1.5.1 2006-02-27:
	- Some bugs in the documentation removed.
	
* Version 1.5 2005-10-18:
	- Typo in "RGEHowTo.nb" and "First Steps" section of the manual:
	  The Majorana phases are set by RGE\[CurlyPhi]i rather than RGE\[Phi]i
	- New output function RGEPoleMTop which returns the pole mass of the top quark

* Version 1.4 2005-07-22:
	- RGERotateM: The basis of the output was changed from the requirement that M is diagonal to M is real and diagonal. This solves a bug in the output function RGE\[Epsilon]1.
